## Architecture

Our repository for the project has the following architecture:

```
* 1_NaiveBayes : Contains the subject and the notebook for our first lab on the naive bayes classifier.

* 2_FastText : Contains the subject and the notebook for our second lab on the FastText library.

* 3_RNN : Contains the subject and the notebook for our third lab on the usage of an RNN and of an LSTM to classify text.

* requirements.txt

* README.md
```

Each notebook of the labs contains the work done during the lab, with some comments to  describe our technical choices, and analyse our results.
